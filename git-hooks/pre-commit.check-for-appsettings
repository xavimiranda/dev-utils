# This Git pre-commit hook checks for any staged 'appsettings' files and prompts the user for confirmation before proceeding with the commit.
# This is useful to prevent accidentally committing sensitive configuration information, specially in .Net projects, where appsettings can have
# credentials that shouldn't be pushed to the remote repository
#
# How it works:
# - The hook scans the staged files (using 'git diff --cached --name-only') and looks for any file with 'appsettings' in its name.
# - If one or more 'appsettings' files are found, it issues a warning and prompts the user to confirm if they want to continue with the commit.
# - The prompt asks for a 'y' or 'n' input, where only 'y' allows the commit to proceed.
# - If the response is anything other than 'y', the commit is aborted.
#
# Usage:
# - Place this script in the `.git/hooks/` directory of your repository.
# - Ensure the script has execute permissions (e.g., run `chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit`).
#
if git diff --cached --name-only | grep -q 'appsettings'; then
	echo "Warning: appsettings files(s) are staged for commit."
        # Fallback for environments without /dev/tty (like Visual Studio)
        read -p "Are you sure you want to continue with the commit? (y/n): " confirm < /dev/tty
	if [[ "$confirm" != "y" ]]; then
		#echo "Commit aborted."
		exit 1 
	fi;
fi;
